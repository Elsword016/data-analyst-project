# Data Analyst Projects
## List of projects 

This is my self-learning roadmap for data science. I mainly focus on healthcare-related applications since I'm a biologist. Most of my projects will have:
- Data cleaning and stuffs
- Exploratory Data Analysis and inferences from them
- Using ML algorithms to predict
- A rich annotation to follow along
- Model deployment mainly using Python-Streamlit

## Dependencies

All the projects are written using Python and its dependencies on the Jupyter Notebook framework. The packages/libraries mostly used are:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Ploty,express(less use case but definitely a good one)
- Streamlit
